### Hi!

### I'm a full stack web developer with a background in science (food chemistry) and a passion for creating and improving.

### Here are some of my projects:
- - - -
### Vicaty
- [Vicaty](https://vicaty.herokuapp.com/)
- [REPO: Vicaty headless CMS SERVER](https://github.com/edvicaty/vicaty-server)
- [REPO: Vicaty headless CMS CLIENT](https://github.com/edvicaty/vicaty-client)
- [REPO: Vicaty headless CMS API](https://github.com/edvicaty/vicaty-API)

This app is a full stack app made with react, node.js, express and antD, using passport for authenticacion, and Mongo for DB.
IÂ´ve made this app with the intention to create something useful and backend focused.
Vicaty has 3 repos. The main repo (vicaty-server) is in charge of handling the requests coming directly from the client (vicaty-client repo),
Vicaty also has a repo for its API, which is in charge of handling all the requests coming from any external site (no passport authentication).

### Merca-app
- [Merca-app](https://merca-app.herokuapp.com/)
- [REPO: Full-stack price consulting app with official PROFECO data and user data feedback for CDMX](https://github.com/edvicaty/Merca-App)

I've made this app with the intention to create something useful and interesting for my community.
I used a little web scraping to get official PROFECO data (sadly PROFECO doesn't have an API).
This app was built with express.js, Node.js, Mapbox, Handlebars, and Mongo.
